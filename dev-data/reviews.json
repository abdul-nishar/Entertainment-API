    "review": "This movie showcases that the right amount of pacing, suspense and emotion can really bring a script with little dialogue to life. It really worked for me and I loved Smith in this role. He embodied this character and really put his heart into it. That made it possible to go from seeing beyond Will Smith acting in a film to seeing Robert Neville come to life on the screen through Will Smith's craft. He let the character take the lead and that is what good actors are supposed to do. He transformed and it was believable.",

    "review": "The film has great emotion, especially at one part which you will know when you see it. The tone is consistently serious which is what it should be. There a few chuckles here and there which work well with the context.",

    "review": "One thing's for sure about James Cameron: the man's imagination is always on fire. Always. And that's never a bad thing, is it? AVATAR is another example of Cameron's imagination running wild, creating a vivid and immersive world that, despite the somewhat thin story and characters, I am happy to revisit any time.",
